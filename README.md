# Arena_lib

Arena_lib is a library for Minetest working as a core for any arena minigame you have in mind.  
It comes with an arena manager and a signs system. The latter creates a bridge inside your own server between the hub and your actual mod (deathmatch, capture the flag, assault, you name it). In other words, you don't have to do the boring job and you can focus exclusively on your minigame(s) :*

### Config

1) Install it as any other mod

2) Launch the world at least once with arena_lib enabled and then check `worlds/nameofyourworld/arena_lib` to customise it

3) (modders only) First time? Check out the [wiki](https://gitlab.com/zughy-friends-minetest/arena_lib/-/wikis/Your-first-minigame) to create your first minigame! Otherwise, dive into the [full documentation](DOCS.md)

### Dependencies
* (bundled) [ChatCMDBuilder](https://github.com/rubenwardy/ChatCmdBuilder/) by rubenwardy
* [signs_lib](https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/signs_lib/) by Vanessa Dannenberg  
* (optional) [Parties](https://gitlab.com/zughy-friends-minetest/parties) by me: use it to be sure to join the same arena/team as your friends

#### Add-ons
* [Hub](https://gitlab.com/zughy-friends-minetest/hub) by me: use it if you're aiming for a full minigame server. It can't be set as an optional dependency, since arena_lib is a hard dependency of Hub in the first place (and MT doesn't like cross dependencies) 

### Known conflicts
* `Beds` or any other mod overriding the default respawn system
* `SkinsDB` or any other mod applying a 3D model onto the player, if `teams_color_overlay` is used
* `Weather` or any other mod changing players skybox at runtime (custom celestial vaults will be overridden)

#### Mods relying on arena_lib
* [Block League](https://gitlab.com/zughy-friends-minetest/block_league)
* [Murder](https://gitlab.com/giov4/minetest-murder-mod)
* [Skywars](https://gitlab.com/zughy-friends-minetest/skywars)
* ...and many more! ([full list](https://content.minetest.net/metapackages/arena_lib/))

### Want to help?
Feel free to:
* open an [issue](https://gitlab.com/zughy-friends-minetest/arena_lib/-/issues)
* submit a merge request. In this case, PLEASE, do follow milestones and my [coding guidelines](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/-l75iHl3x54py20u2Y5OSAX4iruQBdeQXcO7PGTtGew/embed/). I won't merge features for milestones that are different from the upcoming one (if it's declared), nor messy code
