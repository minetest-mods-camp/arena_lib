**EDITING THIS FOLDER IS USELESS, EDIT THE ONE CALLED arena_lib IN THE WORLD FOLDER INSTEAD**  
  
The first time the world is launched with `arena_lib` on, this folder is copy-pasted into the world folder (with the sole exception of this file). The purpose of this folder is to provide all the files and the structure to customise arena_lib.
