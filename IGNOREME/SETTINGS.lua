-- instead of letting modders put whatever colour they want in the sky settings,

-- edit it manually; instead, if you want to change it, pick your favourite from
-- Lospec: https://lospec.com/palette-list, edit the list and it'll be
-- automatically updated in game. Do not remove "_default" and keep all letters
